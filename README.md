## Overview

This application allows you to easily install a custom Web application,
providing files access with [SFTP](https://yunohost.org/en/filezilla). It can also create a MySQL database -
which will be backed up and restored with your application. The connection
details will be stored in the file `db_accesss.txt` located in the root
directory.

PHP-FPM version can also be selected among 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0.

**Once installed, go to the chosen URL to know the user, domain and port 
you will have to use for the SFTP access.** The password is one you chosen
during the installation. Under the Web directory, you will see a `www` folder
which contains the public files served by this app. You can put all the files
of your custom Web application inside.

**Shipped version:** 1.0
